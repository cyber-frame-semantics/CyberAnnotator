## Watch Out! If it's your first time to run things about wordnet and framenet, please 
## uncomment the code ">> import nltk >> nltk.download("all")" before you run it. It will 
## take a few minutes to download all required pieces. Then just comment the two lines of 
## codes and re-run the app

- cannot find all keys in some JSON file
- The output shown by streamlit is kind messy
- Need to handle case that some keys' synsets are empty

### Funtions missing
- output meaningful text

### Possible upgrade
- improve code efficiency
